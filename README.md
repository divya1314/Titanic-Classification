# Titanic Classification Project

## Project Overview
The Titanic Classification Project aims to build a predictive model using data science techniques in Python to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization to gain insights into the factors influencing survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, available [here](link to dataset). It contains information about passengers such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and survival status.

## Project Steps
```python
# 1. Data Loading and Exploration
# Load and explore the dataset

# 2. Data Preprocessing
# Handle missing values
# Extract titles from passenger names
# Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables
# Drop unnecessary columns

# 3. Feature Scaling
# Scale features using StandardScaler

# 4. Model Training
# Train two machine learning models:
#   - Logistic Regression
#   - Random Forest Classifier

# 5. Model Evaluation
# Evaluate models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

# 6. Visualization
# Create various visualizations to understand data distribution and the relationship between different features and survival rates
